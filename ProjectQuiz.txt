What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

CDN is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet
1. Decrease Server Load
    -Content is spread out across several servers as opposed to only one large server
2. Faster Content Delivery
    -CDNs place servers as close to a group of users as possible. Latency and packet loss are minimalized due to shorter travel distance.
3. Increase in the Number of Concurrent Users
    -CDN can result in high network backbone capacity. This allows more users to access the network at a given time.
4. 100 Percent Availability
    -Due to the distribution across many regions, CDNs have automatic server availability sensing mechanisms with instant user redirection.
